                    <div class="faq-answer text-gray-600">
                        <p><b>Part 141 training</b></p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                            <li>Specific training syllabus approved by the FAA.</li>
                            <li>Very structured and regimented training course.</li>
                            <li>Formal ground school with a specific amount of hours required.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Pros:</b> A very structured training process in a classroom environment that may appeal to some students. To utilize military benefits along with Visa holders are required to train part 141.</p>
                        <p><b>Cons:</b> The overall process is generally more expensive and takes longer. The lack of flexibility in the training process can lead to frustration.</p>
                        <p><b>Part 61 training</b></p>

                            <li>Home ground school can be supervised with no minimum hour requirement.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Pros:</b> Custom tailored training to the individual student. Ground school can be done at home and supervised by the school and/or the instructor at a much lower cost. The overall training cost can be significantly lower.</p>
                        <p><b>Cons:</b> Some students learn better in a vigorous structured environment, many part 61 training opportunities do not offer that, but some do.</p>
                        <p><b>Note:</b> Keep in mind both a part 141 and part 61 student must pass the same FAA written exam, and must demonstrate the same knowledge and flight tasks to a check pilot or a designated pilot examiner (DPE) to achieve a pilot certificate or rating.</p>

                        <p>Yes, as long as your vision can be corrected with glasses you should have no problems. If you are color blind additional tests will be required, the private pilot certificate and a career in the airlines is still possible.

                        <p>That is a great question, but difficult to answer. The minimum number of flight hours to get your private pilot certificate is 40 hours. However, the national average is 71 hours. Variables such as how frequently you train (2-3 times per week is recommended), how hard you study at home, and individual skill greatly impact the final cost. <br /><b>*BEWARE</b> of anybody quoting an exact price to complete your private pilot certificate. <br />Call us today for current quotes for both airplanes and instructional rates.<b> Free consultations available</b></p>

                    <h3 class="faq-question text-xl font-bold mb-2">Do I need a 3rd class medical certificate/student pilot certificate to become a private pilot? What are they?</h3>
                    <div class="faq-answer text-gray-600">
                        <p>Yes. A 3rd class medical is issued by an Aviation Medical Examiner (AME), see the link below to find a doctor in your area. The purpose of the 3rd class medical is to determine if you are in good enough health to pilot an airplane. This medical certificate also serves as your student pilot certificate. <br /><b>Before you leave the doctor's office verify EVERYTHING is EXACTLY matching your government issued ID 100%. Any discrepancy will cause undue delays when taking the final flight check.</b><br />This medical certificate must remain valid anytime you are acting as pilot in command (PIC). This means you are the "sole" manipulator of the flight controls. 1st and 2nd class medical certificates may also be required, call for assistance. <br /><i><b>Note:</b> You can start your flight training prior to getting your 3rd class medical certificate. However, you cannot solo until you have your medical certificate.</i><br /><a href="https://www.faa.gov/pilots/amelocator/" target="_blank">Find a Doctor nearby</a></p>
