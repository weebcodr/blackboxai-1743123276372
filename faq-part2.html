            <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">I wear glasses or I am color blind can I become a private pilot and eventually a commercial pilot?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Yes, as long as your vision can be corrected with glasses you should have no problems. If you are color blind additional tests will be required, the private pilot certificate and a career in the airlines is still possible. This serves as a good reminder to get your medical completed prior to any flight training.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">How much will it cost me to get my Private Pilot Certificate?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">That is a great question, but difficult to answer. The minimum number of flight hours to get your private pilot certificate is 40 hours. However, the national average is 71 hours. Variables such as how frequently you train (2-3 times per week is recommended), how hard you study at home, and individual skill greatly impact the final cost. <br><b>*BEWARE</b> of anybody quoting an exact price to complete your private pilot certificate. <br>Call us today for current quotes for both airplanes and instructional rates.<b> Free consultations available</b></p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Do I need a 3rd class medical certificate/student pilot certificate to become a private pilot? What are they?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Yes. A 3rd class medical is issued by an Aviation Medical Examiner (AME), see the link below to find a doctor in your area. The purpose of the 3rd class medical is to determine if you are in good enough health to pilot an airplane. This medical certificate also serves as your student pilot certificate. <br><b>Before you leave the doctor's office verify EVERYTHING is EXACTLY matching your government issued ID 100%. Any discrepancy will cause undue delays when taking the final flight check.</b><br>This medical certificate must remain valid anytime you are acting as pilot in command (PIC). This means you are the "sole" manipulator of the flight controls. 1st and 2nd class medical certificates may also be required, call for assistance. <br><i><b>Note:</b> You can start your flight training prior to getting your 3rd class medical certificate. However, you cannot solo until you have your medical certificate.</i><br><a href="https://www.faa.gov/pilots/amelocator/" target="_blank">Find a Doctor nearby</a></p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">How do I choose my flight instructor?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">We advise that you interview multiple instructors and perhaps even fly with a few to determine the best fit for your personality. Remember you are interviewing to hire this person to provide adequate training and to keep you safe as you learn.<br><b>Questions to ask:</b></p>
