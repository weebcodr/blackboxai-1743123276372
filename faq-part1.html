                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">What is the difference between training part 61 and part 141?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600"><b>Part 141 training</b><br />
<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
  <li>Specific training syllabus approved by the FAA.</li>
  <li>Very structured and regimented training course.</li>
  <li>Formal ground school with a specific amount of hours required.</li>
</ul>
<b>Pros:</b> A very structured training process in a classroom environment that may appeal to some students. To utilize military benefits along with Visa holders are required to train part 141.<br />
<b>Cons:</b> The overall process is generally more expensive and takes longer. The lack of flexibility in the training process can lead to frustration.<br />
<b>Part 61 training</b><br />
<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
  <li>Custom tailored training approved by the FAA.</li>
  <li>Instructor and student work together to establish a schedule that fits the student's schedule and lifestyle.</li>
  <li>Home ground school can be supervised with no minimum hour requirement.</li>
</ul>
<b>Pros:</b> Custom tailored training to the individual student. Ground school can be done at home and supervised by the school and/or the instructor at a much lower cost. The overall training cost can be significantly lower.<br />
<b>Cons:</b> Some students learn better in a vigorous structured environment, many part 61 training opportunities do not offer that, but some do.<br />
<b>Note:</b> Keep in mind both a part 141 and part 61 student must pass the same FAA written exam, and must demonstrate the same knowledge and flight tasks to a check pilot or a designated pilot examiner (DPE) to achieve a pilot certificate or rating.
